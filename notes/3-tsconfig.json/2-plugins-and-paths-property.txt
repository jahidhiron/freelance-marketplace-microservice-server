"plugins": [{ "transform": "typescript-transform-paths" }, { "transform": "typescript-transform-paths", "afterDeclarations": true }],
"paths": {
    "@notifications/*": ["src/*"]
},


The configuration you're referring to involves using the typescript-transform-paths plugin in a TypeScript project. 
This plugin is often used in conjunction with the paths option in tsconfig.json to handle module path aliasing more
effectively during both compilation and transformation stages. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each part does:

paths Configuration:

"paths": {
  "@notifications/*": ["src/*"]
}

Purpose: 
The paths option in tsconfig.json allows you to define custom path aliases for your modules. 
This can simplify imports and make your codebase more maintainable.

Example: 
If you have a file at src/components/Notification.ts, instead of importing it using a relative path like this:

import { Notification } from '../../components/Notification';

You can import it using the alias:

import { Notification } from '@notifications/components/Notification';


How It Works: 
The paths setting maps the alias @notifications/* to the src/* directory. This means that any import 
that starts with @notifications/ will be resolved relative to the src directory.

typescript-transform-paths Plugin:
"plugins": [
  { "transform": "typescript-transform-paths" },
  { "transform": "typescript-transform-paths", "afterDeclarations": true }
]

Purpose: The typescript-transform-paths plugin ensures that these path aliases are correctly 
transformed during the TypeScript compilation process. This is particularly useful when generating 
output files that need to maintain these paths, such as in CommonJS or ES module output.

First Plugin Entry:
{ "transform": "typescript-transform-paths" }

This entry handles the transformation of paths in your TypeScript source files. It ensures that the 
path aliases are resolved and transformed into relative paths in the emitted JavaScript files.

Second Plugin Entry (afterDeclarations: true):
{ "transform": "typescript-transform-paths", "afterDeclarations": true }

This entry ensures that the path transformations are also applied to your declaration (.d.ts) files. 
This is crucial if you are generating type declarations for your project and want to maintain consistent path aliases.
