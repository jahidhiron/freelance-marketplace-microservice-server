The .editorconfig file you've provided is a configuration file for EditorConfig, 
a tool that helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs. 
This file defines a set of rules for how files in your project should be formatted, 
ensuring that all contributors to the project follow the same formatting conventions, 
regardless of their personal editor settings.

Breakdown of the .editorconfig File:

root = true:
This indicates that this is the top-most .editorconfig file in your project. If there are other 
.editorconfig files in parent directories, they will be ignored.

[*] Section:
This section applies to all files in the project, unless overridden by more specific sections.

charset = utf-8
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

charset = utf-8: Ensures that all files are saved with UTF-8 encoding.

indent_style = space: Specifies that spaces should be used for indentation (instead of tabs).

indent_size = 2: Sets the number of spaces per indentation level to 2. This controls the visual 
width of each indentation level.

end_of_line = lf: Ensures that line endings are set to LF (Line Feed), which is the standard 
for Unix/Linux and macOS systems. This avoids issues with inconsistent line endings, especially 
when working on cross-platform projects.

insert_final_newline = true: Ensures that a newline is added at the end of each file if it's missing.

trim_trailing_whitespace = true: Automatically removes any whitespace characters at the end of each line, 
helping to keep the code clean and avoid unnecessary changes in version control.

[*.{ts,js}] Section:
This section applies specifically to TypeScript (.ts) and JavaScript (.js) files.

quote_type = single: 
Enforces the use of single quotes (') for string literals in 
TypeScript and JavaScript files. This helps maintain consistency in string formatting 
across the codebase.

[*.md] Section:
This section applies specifically to Markdown (.md) files.

max_line_length = off
trim_trailing_whitespace = false

max_line_length = off: 
Disables any enforcement of maximum line length in Markdown files. 
This is useful since Markdown files often contain long URLs, code blocks, or text that doesn't 
neatly fit within a standard line length.

trim_trailing_whitespace = false: 
Prevents the trimming of trailing whitespace in Markdown files. In Markdown, trailing 
whitespace at the end of a line is sometimes used intentionally to create line breaks, so this 
rule helps preserve those.
