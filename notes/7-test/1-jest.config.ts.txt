This Jest configuration is tailored for testing a TypeScript project, and it uses 
the ts-jest preset for running tests. Let's break down what each part of 

the configuration does:

1. preset: 'ts-jest':
This preset is used to configure Jest to handle TypeScript files. 
It allows Jest to transpile .ts files using ts-jest before running the tests.

2. testEnvironment: 'node':
Specifies that the test environment should be Node.js. This means Jest will 
simulate a Node environment (instead of a browser environment) while running tests.

3. verbose: true:
This flag makes Jest output more detailed information about the individual test cases, 
showing whether each test passes or fails with descriptions.

4. coverageDirectory: 'coverage':
Specifies the directory (coverage/) where the code coverage reports will be saved. 
The reports will show how much of your code is covered by tests.

5. collectCoverage: true:
Enables code coverage collection, meaning Jest will track which parts of the code 
were executed during testing and generate a report.

6. testPathIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules']:
Tells Jest to ignore the node_modules/ folder when looking for test files, so tests 
won't be run on any dependencies.

7. transform: { '^.+\\.ts?$': 'ts-jest' }:
This tells Jest to transform (or transpile) files that match the regular expression 
(^.+\\.ts?$), i.e., .ts files (TypeScript files), using ts-jest. This allows Jest 
to run TypeScript files without needing to precompile them.

8. testMatch: ['<rootDir>/src/**/test/*.ts']:
Defines the pattern for where Jest should look for test files. In this case, 
it's telling Jest to only run tests that are in the test folders within src/, and only on .ts files.

Example:
A test file could be located at src/someModule/test/someTest.ts.

9. collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*.ts', '!src/**/test/*.ts?(x)', '!**/node_modules/**']:
Specifies which files should be included in the coverage report.
src/**/*.ts: Collects coverage for all .ts files in the src directory.
!src/**/test/*.ts?(x): Excludes .ts files in test folders (so your actual test 
files are not counted towards coverage).

!**/node_modules/**: Excludes the node_modules folder from coverage.

10. coverageThreshold: { global: { branches: 1, functions: 1, lines: 1, statements: 1 } }:
Sets the minimum code coverage thresholds that must be met globally. In this case, the 
thresholds are very low (1% coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements), 
which means as long as some coverage exists, the tests won't fail due to coverage.

11. coverageReporters: ['text-summary', 'lcov']:
Specifies which coverage reporters should be used:
text-summary: Prints a summary of the coverage results to the console.
lcov: Generates an lcov report (a file-based coverage report) that can be 
viewed in a browser or used by CI systems to display detailed coverage data.

12. moduleNameMapper: { '@notifications/(.*)': ['<rootDir>/src/$1'] }:
This is used for module path aliasing. It tells Jest to map any imports 
starting with @notifications/ to the corresponding file in the src directory.

For example, an import like @notifications/config will be resolved as <rootDir>/src/config.
