"publishConfig": {
  "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
}


The "publishConfig" field in a package.json file specifies configuration 
options for publishing the package. When you include "publishConfig" in 
your package.json, it customizes the behavior of the npm publish command. 
The specific field "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com" tells npm to 
publish the package to a specific registry, in this case, GitHub's package registry.

What It Does:

Custom Registry for Publishing:
The "registry" field inside "publishConfig" overrides the default npm registry 
(https://registry.npmjs.org/) and tells npm to publish your package to the GitHub 
Package Registry at https://npm.pkg.github.com.

GitHub Package Registry:
The GitHub Package Registry is a service provided by GitHub that allows you to 
host and manage your npm packages directly on GitHub.
This is useful if you want to distribute your packages privately within your 
organization or for open-source projects that are closely tied to GitHub repositories.

Use Case:

Private Packages: If you're developing private packages that should only be accessible 
to specific users or teams, you can use the GitHub Package Registry to control access.

Scoped Packages: Often, this is used with scoped packages, especially in organizations 
that use GitHub extensively.
