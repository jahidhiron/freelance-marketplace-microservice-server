babel src --presets=./scripts/babel-preset.js --extensions .ts,.tsx --ignore src/**/*.specs.tsx --out-dir build/cjs --source-maps

Summary:
This command sets the NODE_ENV to production (indicating a production environment) and BABEL_ENV to cjs 
(indicating that Babel should use the CommonJS Modules configuration).
This command uses Babel to transpile TypeScript (.ts) and TypeScript with JSX (.tsx) files from 
the src directory, excluding test files (*.specs.tsx). The transpiled files are output to the 
build/cjs directory, with source maps generated for debugging purposes. 
The Babel configuration is customized using a preset defined in ./scripts/babel-preset.js.

Breakdown:

NODE_ENV=production:

NODE_ENV is an environment variable that indicates the environment in which the Node.js application is running.
production signifies that the application is being built for a production environment, which 
typically enables optimizations and disables certain development features (e.g., more aggressive minification, 
disabling dev tools, etc.).

BABEL_ENV=cjs:

BABEL_ENV is an environment variable used by Babel to determine which configuration to use.
cjs indicates that Babel should use the configuration or settings defined for CommonJS Modules (cjs). 
This can influence which presets and plugins are applied during the transpilation process, 
particularly if the Babel configuration file (babel-preset.js) has different settings based on the environment.

babel src:

babel: 
This is the Babel CLI command used to transpile files.
src: 
This specifies the directory containing the source files that Babel will process. Here, it's the src directory.
--presets=./scripts/babel-preset.js:

--presets: 
This option tells Babel which preset configuration to use for the transpilation process. 
Presets are collections of Babel plugins that enable specific language features or transformations.
./scripts/babel-preset.js: 
This points to a custom Babel preset configuration file located at ./scripts/babel-preset.js. 
This file contains the presets and plugins that Babel will use during the transpilation.
--extensions .ts,.tsx:

--extensions: 
This option specifies which file extensions Babel should process. Here, it is configured to 
handle .ts (TypeScript) and .tsx (TypeScript with JSX) files.

--ignore src/**/*.specs.tsx:

--ignore: 
This option tells Babel to ignore certain files or patterns. In this case, it will ignore 
all files that match the pattern src/**/*.specs.tsx. This typically means any test files with 
a .specs.tsx extension will be excluded from the transpilation process.

--out-dir build/cjs:

--out-dir: 
This option specifies the output directory for the transpiled files. In this case, 
the transpiled files will be placed in the build/cjs directory.
The choice of cjs as part of the output directory name suggests that the output is 
intended to be in CommonJS format (possibly due to other configurations in the Babel preset).

--source-maps:

--source-maps: This option tells Babel to generate source maps for the transpiled files. 
Source maps are useful for debugging because they map the transpiled code back to the 
original source code, allowing developers to debug the code as if they were running 
the original TypeScript or JSX files.
