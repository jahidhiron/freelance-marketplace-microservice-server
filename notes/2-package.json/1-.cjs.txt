The .cjs file extension stands for "CommonJS" and is typically used in Node.js projects to indicate that 
the file uses the CommonJS module system. This is particularly relevant in projects that use both 
CommonJS (require/module.exports) and ECMAScript Modules (ESM) (import/export) in the same codebase.

When to Use .cjs:
Node.js Module Resolution: 
In Node.js, the .cjs extension explicitly tells the runtime that the file should be treated as a CommonJS module, even if 
the project is set up to use ECMAScript modules by default (for example, when "type": "module" is specified in the package.json).

Hybrid Projects: 
If you're working on a project that mixes CommonJS and ESM, using .cjs for CommonJS files and .mjs for ESM 
files can help avoid confusion and errors related to module imports.

Example:

// example.cjs
const fs = require('fs');

module.exports = function readFile(filePath) {
  return fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
};

This file can be safely imported in another CommonJS module or in an ESM module using dynamic import:

// ESM file
import readFile from './example.cjs';

Common Use Cases:
Legacy Code: When dealing with older Node.js codebases that use CommonJS, you might use .cjs to differentiate 
from newer code that uses ESM.

Package Development: 
If you're developing a package that needs to support both CommonJS and ESM, you might have .cjs files for 
backward compatibility.

In summary, .cjs is a way to ensure that a file is treated as a CommonJS module in environments 
where both CommonJS and ESM are in use.
