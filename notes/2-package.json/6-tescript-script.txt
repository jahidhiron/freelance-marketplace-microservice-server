"test": "jest --coverage=true -w=1 --forceExit --detectOpenHandles --watchAll=false"


Explanation of Each Part:
jest:

This is the command to run the Jest testing framework.
--coverage=true:

This flag generates a code coverage report. Code coverage measures the 
percentage of your code that is tested by the Jest test suite 
(e.g., how many functions, lines, and branches are covered by tests).
This report can be found in the coverage/ folder after the test run.

-w=1:
-w or --maxWorkers=1 limits Jest to run only one worker process at a time.
Jest usually runs tests in parallel to improve performance. 
By setting this to 1, you're telling Jest to run tests serially, 
one at a time, which can be useful when debugging issues or dealing 
with resource constraints.

--forceExit:
This flag forces Jest to exit after the tests complete, even if there 
are asynchronous tasks still running.
This can be useful when there are open handles (like unclosed database 
connections, timers, etc.) that would otherwise prevent Jest from exiting normally.

--detectOpenHandles:
This flag instructs Jest to detect and print any open handles that 
could prevent the process from exiting.
This helps in identifying potential issues like unclosed 
database connections, file handles, timers, or sockets.

--watchAll=false:
This flag disables Jest's watch mode, which reruns tests when files change.
By setting --watchAll=false, you ensure that Jest runs the tests 
once and exits, which is common in Continuous Integration (CI) environments.
